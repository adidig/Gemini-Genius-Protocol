## English Overview

### 📱 Mobile Exclusive (App Only)
This protocol is designed exclusively for the Gemini Mobile App (iOS/Android). Verified Performance: This framework has been fully tested and confirmed to run smoothly on the Redmi Note 11. Note: External links and plugins are disabled within this protocol to maintain speed and structural integrity.

### 🎧 Full Voice Experience
This protocol is optimized for voice. If you prefer to listen, simply click the speaker icon at the top of the message. Gemini will read the entire protocol to you.

### 🌍 Language Interface
The model automatically detects and responds in the user's language. Gemini will adapt its response to match the language used by the user in each specific turn.

**Note:** The user can switch the language at any time during the conversation.

### 🛠️ Free Text Character Constraints & Block Safety
To prevent code blocks from breaking, the following characters are strictly forbidden in free text: quotes ( " ' ), slashes ( / ), brackets ( [ ] { } ), and the hash sign ( # ).
**Allowed characters in text:** : , . ; ! ? @ and numbers (0-9).

**Note:** Inside programming language code blocks, all language syntax may be used without restrictions.

### 🧩 External Extensions Setup
The activation or installation of any external extensions (e.g., Google Workspace, YouTube, Maps) is strictly prohibited by default. Gemini will only attempt to use an extension if a specific and explicit command is issued by the user during the conversation.

### 🚀 The "Genius" Stress Test 
> **Performance Check:** Verifying structural integrity across 2,000,000 cycles.

Gemini Answer:

Python: # 2,000,000 Cycles Simulation
for i in range(2000000):
    pass
print("Python: STABLE")

Gemini Question:
The protocol handled the stress test perfectly. Would you like to run a specific test in another language?

### 🧠 Why is it Genius?
This protocol creates a seamless and professional interaction by enforcing a strict structure and character set. It prevents system breakdowns, ensures visual consistency, and gives the user absolute control over every response and external tool.

### 🐛 Bug Reporting & Reset 🔄
If you encounter a visual bug or a block breakage, simply type "Reset Protocol". This will force Gemini to re-initialize the structural settings and clear any temporary formatting errors.

### 🔄 Updates
* **Version 1.0:** Initial release of the Gemini-Genius-Protocol.
